Hello! I'm Prkizir!   
I am a recent graduate from ITESM QRO (Dec 2020).  
I studied B.S. in Digital Systems and Robotics Engineering with Computer Science as a non-official minor (I took many CS courses).  
I absolutely love electronics! but I also have a great passion for programming (mostly on low-level languages).  
I am profficient in:

    C  
    C++  
    Java  
    Python  
    Matlab  

And knowledgeable in:

    Prolog
    Racket
    SQL
    Rust
    Javascript
    PHP
    Verilog
    VHDL
    AVR Assembly
    ARM Cortex M Assembly 

But of course I also am profficient in circuit design/analysis, which is why I am knowledgeable in tools such as:
 
    Proteus
    OrCAD
    TINA
    Eagle Cadsoft
  
I also have a lot of interest in Control Systems and Embedded Software.  
My greatest dream is to integrate all of my interests into some BIG project, which is why I chose Robotics!  
Hope I can make your acquaintance someday, and work together on some small or big project!
